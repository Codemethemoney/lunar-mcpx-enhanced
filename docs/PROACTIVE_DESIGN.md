# Lunar MCP Enhanced - Proactive Middleware Design

## Architecture for Always-On Tool Management

### Current Limitation
The current Lunar MCP Enhanced is a **reactive** tool that Claude calls when needed. It doesn't pre-process or intercept prompts.

### Proposed Solution: Lunar Proxy Middleware

## Option 1: Local Proxy Server (Recommended)

Create a standalone service that runs before Claude:

```javascript
// Start Lunar Proxy
npm run proxy

// Then use Claude Desktop normally
// Lunar will intercept and enhance all prompts
```

### Implementation:
1. **Proxy Server** (localhost:8080)
   - Intercepts all prompts via browser extension
   - Pre-analyzes with Lunar logic
   - Builds complete tool execution plans
   - Injects plans into Claude's context

2. **Browser Extension**
   - Monitors Claude Desktop web interface
   - Intercepts user input
   - Sends to Lunar Proxy for analysis
   - Injects enhanced prompts back

3. **Enhanced Prompts**
   ```
   [LUNAR-PLAN-READY]
   Tools to execute:
   1. filesystem:read_file {"path": "/project/config.json"}
   2. github:create_issue {"title": "Config update", ...}
   3. docker-mcp:build {"dockerfile": "..."}
   [END-LUNAR-PLAN]
   
   Original request: Update my project config and deploy
   ```

## Option 2: MCP Gateway Pattern

Replace all MCP tools with a single Lunar Gateway:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lunar-gateway": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/lunar-gateway.js"],
      "env": {
        "LUNAR_MODE": "interceptor",
        "TARGET_TOOLS": "all"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The gateway would:
- Intercept ALL tool calls
- Pre-process with Lunar intelligence
- Route to actual MCP tools
- Cache and learn patterns

## Option 3: Claude Desktop Fork

Fork Claude Desktop to add Lunar as built-in middleware:
- Modify Electron app
- Add prompt preprocessing layer
- Integrate Lunar directly into message flow

## Quick Start for Proxy Approach

```bash
# 1. Install proxy dependencies
cd /Users/garyoleary/.config/lunar-mcpx-enhanced
npm install express ws cors

# 2. Start proxy server
npm run proxy

# 3. Install browser extension
# (Would need to be built)

# 4. Use Claude Desktop normally
# Lunar now intercepts everything!
```

## Benefits of Proactive Approach
- Zero latency - plans ready before Claude processes
- Better context awareness across conversations
- Learning improves over time
- Can batch and optimize tool calls
- Works transparently with Claude

Would you like me to implement the proxy server approach?
